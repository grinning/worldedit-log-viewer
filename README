WorldEdit command logging must be enabled first!
Before running, you need to generate a compatible log file. The following
 command does this, assuming the current directory is of your server:
 
  echo "`cat server.log | grep "WorldEdit: " | cut -c 39-`" > welog.log 

Then you may use WELog by running: 

  ./welog welog.log superflat
